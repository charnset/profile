  I am a third year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Southern California (USC), where I am advised by <a href="https://www.isi.edu/~mirkovic/" target="_blank">Jelena Mirkovic</a>. Previously, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science, specialization in Computer Networks, at USC and B.S. in Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.cpe.ku.ac.th/?lang=en" target="_blank">Kasetsart University</a>, where I was mentored by <a href="https://www.cpe.ku.ac.th/?page_id=1996" target="_blank">Anan Phonphoem</a>,  <a href="https://www.cpe.ku.ac.th/?page_id=1928" target="_blank">Chaiporn Jaikaeo</a>, and <a href="https://www.cpe.ku.ac.th/?page_id=1998" target="_blank">Aphirak Jansang</a>.

  My research spans across different fields of knowledge, including security, privacy, machine learning (especially NLP), and human-computer interaction. Specifically, I focus on understanding human behaviors and perceptions around cybersecurity. My ultimate goal is to apply my findings to improve users' digital security experiences as well as ensure their privacy.
